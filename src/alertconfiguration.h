//  1. Rules are stored in files. One rule = one file
//  2. File name is a rule name
//  3. Files should have extention ".rule"
//  4. Directory to the files is configurable. Cannot be changed without recompilation
//  5. If rule has at least one mistake or broke any other rule, it is ignored
//  6. Rule name is unique
